# Has Done
I think I managed to get the env correct.
I think I managed to download the data of ISIC2018 (see home2)
Run their evaluation on this ISIC2018 and get the same numbers.
Download ISIC2024.

# To Do
1. Use ISIC2018 TopoSwin-MP model to try getting some results on the ISIC2024 dataset.
2. Retrain on the ISIC2024 dataset.
3. Make some tiny-tweaks to the model and hope for better results.
