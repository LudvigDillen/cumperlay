# Has Done
I think I managed to get the env correct.
I think I managed to download the data of ISIC2018 (see home2)
Run their evaluation on this ISIC2018 and get the same numbers.
Download ISIC2024.

# To Do
1. Use ISIC2018 TopoSwin-MP model to try getting some results on the ISIC2024 dataset.
    Compare the data in ISIC2024 and ISIC2024_not_kaggle (and ISIC2018) (any diff?)
    Get inspired by this file: lmp/data/isic2018.py to write the dataloader
    Also need to create a new config file perhaps.
    Actually try to figure out if the isic2018 folder contains sort of the same thing
    as the isic2024 folder so that we can just swap folder in config. Unfortunately, I 
    do not think this is the case.
2. Retrain on the ISIC2024 dataset.
3. Make some tiny-tweaks to the model and hope for better results.
